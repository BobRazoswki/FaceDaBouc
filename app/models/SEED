lazy test writting gem 

getting started => put the line in rails_helper

define a usertype / restauranttype... 

you just change it in one place and it is not breaking all of our test 

create a folder spec/factories
user.rb
tag.rb
post.rb 
...
FactoryGirl.define do
	factory :user do
	email 'bob'
	...
	end
can do inheritance 
	factory :talal do
	email 'b@b.com'
end


end

in the test @alex = create(:user) alex1 =create(:user1)

create(:kfc, user: @alex)

alex advice: 
>no factories with unit test 
>to understand a huge rails project take a look to the factories
